# Robert Hansen — AI Systems Developer  
**Founder, Design Logic · Builder of LOS → Loryne → AdaptE · Prompt Logic Architect**

I design human-language operating systems.

My work is focused on creating structured AI reasoning frameworks — the kind that make large language models behave predictably, interpret instructions cleanly, and run as modular “micro-OS” environments inside any LLM.

Right now I build:

### Design Logic Adaptive Engine (DLAE)
A modular cognitive framework that turns natural language into structured, validated, and routable instructions.

### LOS (Linguistic Operating System)
A packet-based mental model for AI instructions — with Binder v2.0 governance, ARC runtime context, AMC mode routing, and LLpL persistence.

### TruthProbe v1.1  
A portable AI safety + reasoning transparency layer that evaluates confidence, evidence strength, bias risk, and hidden assumptions for *any* LLM.

### What I Work On
- AI system architectures  
- Prompt logic + instruction routing  
- OS-style language models (Loryne → LOS)  
- Evaluation tools  
- Micro-OS product frameworks  
- Transparent, auditable AI reasoning

- ### Architecture Snapshot (2025)

Right now I’m building a layered reasoning stack:

**L0 — Engine (Loryne)**  
Neutral compute substrate for structured reasoning flows.

**L1 — LOS Core (`los-core`)**  
Linguistic Operating System layer: Binder v2.0 governance, ARC runtime context, AMC mode routing, and LLpL semantic persistence.

**L2 — Design Logic Adaptive Engine (DLAE / AdaptE)**  
Modular framework that turns LOS-governed instructions into agents, workflows, and micro-OS environments.

**L3 — Design Logic Studio (DLStudio)**  
Application suite built on AdaptE: agent templates, productized workflows, safety layers, and creator tools.

**L4 — Tools & Probes**  
TruthProbe v1.1, evaluation harnesses, and other reasoning middleware built to run inside LOS-style environments.

If you're exploring structured AI systems, LLM-native workflows, or transparent reasoning layers — I build those.
