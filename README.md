# Robert Hansen — AI Systems Developer  
**Founder, Design Logic · Builder of LOS → Loryne → AdaptE · Prompt Logic Architect**

I design human-language operating systems.

My work is focused on creating structured AI reasoning frameworks — the kind that make large language models behave predictably, interpret instructions cleanly, and run as modular “micro-OS” environments inside any LLM.

Right now I build:

### 🚀 Design Logic Adaptive Engine (DLAE)
A modular cognitive framework that turns natural language into structured, validated, and routable instructions.

### 🧠 LOS (Linguistic Operating System)
A packet-based mental model for AI instructions — with Binder v2.0 governance, ARC runtime context, AMC mode routing, and LLpL persistence.

### 📦 TruthProbe v1.1  
A portable AI safety + reasoning transparency layer that evaluates confidence, evidence strength, bias risk, and hidden assumptions for *any* LLM.

### 🏗️ What I Work On
- AI system architectures  
- Prompt logic + instruction routing  
- OS-style language models (Loryne → LOS)  
- Evaluation tools  
- Micro-OS product frameworks  
- Transparent, auditable AI reasoning

### 🛠️ Repos
- **design-logic-architecture-overview** — mental model + diagrams  
- **truthprobe-ai-safety-layer** — core runtime + spec  
- **truthprobe-evaluation-samples** — evaluation suite + comparisons

If you're exploring structured AI systems, LLM-native workflows, or transparent reasoning layers — I build those.
